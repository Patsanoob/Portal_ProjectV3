# Portal_ProjectV3

Portal_ProjectV3 is my attempt at recreating the mechanics of Valve's Portal.
It was made using UE5 blueprints but also uses of a small bit of C++.
I worked on the project over the summer vacation of 2022.
I acted as the solo dev on this project and was assisted by Lucas Bertoux for the 3D assets.
